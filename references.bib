   abstract = {This paper captures the current state of privacy scholarship in marketing and related disciplines. We examine theoretical perspectives and empirical findings about data and information privacy grouped according to privacy’s role in society, the psychology of privacy, and the economics of privacy. Although a coherent subset of research themes provide deep understanding, theoretical and empirical findings show this narrow focus also has constrained our view of privacy to consumer, organizational, ethical, or legal silos. In response, we take a necessary step toward expanding the privacy domain across these borders, emphasizing the compelling synergies that span multiple interests. We conclude by highlighting future research themes that embody a multidimensional approach, which blends the many interconnected concerns that feature in contemporary privacy questions in marketing. Since internal and external stakeholders are affected in multiple and potentially unforeseen ways by data privacy issues, additional work in this space remains critical and needed.},

Approaches to reducing this power have thus far fallen into four main categories: 1) using antitrust legislation to break up companies such as Facebook and Google; 2) government regulation of content; 3) data portability, or empowering users to move their data between platforms; and 4) applying privacy legislation to limit how platforms can use the data they collect. Yet each of these four approaches is inadequate in its own way. A more promising solution lies in using both technology and regulation to outsource content curation from the dominant platforms to a competitive layer of "middleware companies."},

However, to justify internal funding of new services, an assessment of the financial impact for the service at hand is often required. We approach this by identifying drivers of cost and benefit based on the Service Business Model Canvases of twenty cases. Based on the results, all drivers and their associated models for quantification were consolidated into a single meta-model.

Using the lenses of the demand-based view on value creation and complementarity, the performance impact of two key service business models is examined: the product-oriented model and the customer-oriented model, implemented jointly with product innovation. Results indicate that the interplay between service business model innovation and product innovation results in long-term performance benefits coupled with a degree of short-term performance sacrifice. Service business model innovation in isolation from product innovation results in short-term profit gains but long-term knowledge loss and, thus, market performance decline.

Driven by mutual benefits, or by regulations that require certain data to be published, there is a demand for the exchange and publication of data among various parties. Data in its original form, however, typically contains sensitive information about individuals, and publishing such data will violate individual privacy. The current practice in data publishing relies mainly on policies and guidelines as to what types of data can be published and on agreements on the use of published data. This approach alone may lead to excessive data distortion or insufficient protection. Privacy-preserving data publishing (PPDP) provides methods and tools for publishing useful information while preserving data privacy. Recently, PPDP has received considerable attention in research communities, and many approaches have been proposed for different data publishing scenarios. In this survey, we will systematically summarize and evaluate different approaches to PPDP, study the challenges in practical data publishing, clarify the differences and requirements that distinguish PPDP from other related problems, and propose future research directions. © 2010 ACM.},

These characteristics usually correlate with additional difficulties in storing, analyzing and applying further procedures or extracting results. Big data analytics is the term used to describe the process of researching massive amounts of complex data in order to reveal hidden patterns or identify secret correlations. However, there is an obvious contradiction between the security and privacy of big data and the widespread use of big data. This paper focuses on privacy and security concerns in big data, differentiates between privacy and security and privacy requirements in big data. This paper covers uses of privacy by taking existing methods such as HybrEx, k-anonymity, T-closeness and L-diversity and its implementation in business. There have been a number of privacy-preserving mechanisms developed for privacy protection at different stages (for example, data generation, data storage, and data processing) of a big data life cycle. The goal of this paper is to provide a major review of the privacy preservation mechanisms in big data and present the challenges for existing mechanisms.

Since big data require high computational power and large storage, distributed systems are used. As multiple parties are involved in these systems, the risk of privacy violation is increased. There have been a number of privacy-preserving mechanisms developed for privacy protection at different stages (e.g., data generation, data storage, and data processing) of a big data life cycle. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of the privacy preservation mechanisms in big data and present the challenges for existing mechanisms. In particular, in this paper, we illustrate the infrastructure of big data and the state-of-the-art privacy-preserving mechanisms in each stage of the big data life cycle. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges and future research directions related to privacy preservation in big data.},

   abstract = {In the last decades, pervasive computing is generating a growing quantity of data. Data mining (DM) technology has become increasingly popular. However, the excessive collection and analysis of data may violate the privacy of individuals and organizations, which raises privacy concern. Therefore, a new research area known as privacy-preserving DM (PPDM) has emerged and attracted the attention of many researchers who are interested in preventing privacy disclosure during DM. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of studies on a specific PPDM, known as privacy-preserving association rule mining (PPARM). We present a detailed taxonomy for the existing PPARM algorithms according to multiple dimensions and then conduct a survey of the most relevant PPARM techniques from the literature. Moreover, we survey and elaborate on each type of metrics used to evaluate PPARM algorithms. Finally, we summarize some conclusions and come up with some future directions and challenges.},

   abstract = {Distributed medical, financial, or social databases are analyzed daily for the discovery of patterns and useful information. Privacy concerns have emerged as some database segments contain sensitive data. Data mining techniques are used to parse, process, and manage enormous amounts of data while ensuring the preservation of private information. Cryptography, as shown by previous research, is the most accurate approach to acquiring knowledge while maintaining privacy. In this paper, we present an extension of a privacy-preserving data mining algorithm, thoroughly designed and developed for both horizontally and vertically partitioned databases, which contain either nominal or numeric attribute values. The proposed algorithm exploits the multi-candidate election schema to construct a privacy-preserving tree-augmented naive Bayesian classifier, a more robust variation of the classical naive Bayes classifier. The exploitation of the Paillier cryptosystem and the distinctive homomorphic primitive shows in the security analysis that privacy is ensured and the proposed algorithm provides strong defences against common attacks. Experiments deriving the benefits of real world databases demonstrate the preservation of private data while mining processes occur and the efficient handling of both database partition types.},

We report the results of an exploratory field experiment in Switzerland that assessed the factors driving the net payoff to users of mobile businesses. We found that (1) the personal data disclosed by users has a negative effect on user payoff; (2) the amount of personalization available has a direct and positive effect, as well as a moderating effect, on user payoff; and (3) the amount of control over a user's personal data has a direct and positive effect, as well as a moderating effect, on user payoff. The results suggest that privacy protection could be the main value proposition in the B2C mobile market. From our theoretical model, we derive a set of guidelines to design a privacy-friendly business model pattern for thirdparty services. We discuss four examples to show how the mobile platform can play a key role in the implementation of these new business models. © 2011 Universidad de Talca - Chile.},

Control over these data assets seems to explain the emergence and dominance of so-called “Big Tech” firms, consisting of Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google/Alphabet, and Facebook. These US-based firms are some of the largest in the world by market capitalization, a position that they retain despite growing policy and public condemnation—or “techlash”—of their market power based on their monopolistic control of personal data. We analyse the transformation of personal data into an asset in order to explore how personal data is accounted for, governed, and valued by Big Tech firms and other political-economic actors (e.g., investors). However, our findings show that Big Tech firms turn “users” and “user engagement” into assets through the performative measurement, governance, and valuation of user metrics (e.g., user numbers, user engagement), rather than extending ownership and control rights over personal data per se. We conceptualize this strategy as a form of “techcraft” to center attention on the means and mechanisms that Big Tech firms deploy to make users and user data measurable and legible as future revenue streams.},

The question of how to capture the business potential associated with data, drives researchers to explore the impact of data and analytics on the business model concept. However, little research has been conducted on how an organization should approach to enrich its existing business model with data or, yet, to develop a completely new, data-driven business model.Our research aims to address this issue by providing a process model for data-driven business model innovation. Therefore, we conduct an extensive review of existing business model innovation processes and derive distinct requirements, taking into account both data specific and business model innovation specific characteristics. The requirements are used to assess the suitability of the identified processes for the development of a data-driven business model. We disclose that existing processes are not appropriate for creating such business models. Based on these findings, we design a new, data-driven business model innovation process that meets the data specific requirements.},

   abstract = {This position paper observes how different technical and normative conceptions of privacy have evolved in parallel and describes the practical challenges that these divergent approaches pose. Notably, past technologies relied on intuitive, heuristic understandings of privacy that have since been shown not to satisfy expectations for privacy protection. With computations ubiquitously integrated in almost every aspect of our lives, it is increasingly important to ensure that privacy technologies provide protection that is in line with relevant social norms and normative expectations. Similarly, it is also important to examine social norms and normative expectations with respect to the evolving scientific study of privacy. To this end, we argue for a rigorous analysis of the mapping from normative to technical concepts of privacy and vice versa. We review the landscape of normative and technical definitions of privacy and discuss specific examples of gaps between definitions that are relevant in the context of privacy in statistical computation. We then identify opportunities for overcoming their differences in the design of new approaches to protecting privacy in accordance with both technical and normative standards.

To investigate the design space of potential visual and non-textual modalities within creative live streams, we first analyzed existing Twitch extensions and conducted a formative study with streamers who share creative activities to uncover key challenges that these streamers face. We then designed and implemented a prototype system, StreamSketch, which enables viewers and streamers to interact during live streams using multiple modalities, including freeform sketches and text. The prototype was evaluated by two professional artist streamers and their viewers during six streaming sessions. Overall, streamers and viewers found that StreamSketch provided increased engagement and new affordances compared to the traditional text-only modality, and highlighted how efficiency, moderation, and tool integration were continued challenges.},

Methodologies like the Privacy by Design (PbD) are still vague and leave many open questions on how to apply them in practice. In this work we propose a new concept, called Privacy by Evidence (PbE), in the form of a software development methodology to provide privacy-awareness. Given the difficulty in providing total privacy in many applications, we propose to document the mitigations in form of evidences of privacy, aiming to increase the confidence of the project. To validate its effectiveness, PbE has been used during the development of four case studies: a smart metering application; a people counting and monitoring application; an energy efficiency monitoring system; and a two factor authentication system. For these applications, the teams were able to provide seven, five, five, and four evidences of privacy, respectively, and we conclude that PbE can be effective in helping to understand and address the privacy protection needs when developing software.},
