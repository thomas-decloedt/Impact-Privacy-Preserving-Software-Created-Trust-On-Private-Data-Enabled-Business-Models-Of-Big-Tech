%Context
The distribution of personal data is undeniably an important aspect in communication nowadays due to the rise of social media and the enhancements in technology. 
Many \glspl{PPM} have already been established to offer protection of personal data. 
Consequently, businesses must adapt to this explosion of data circulation and all the privacy concerns that come with it.

%Need
A rigid structure for the classification of both \glspl{BM} and the concept of privacy is not yet in place. This is due to the rapid evolution of communication and market technology. 

%Task/Object
An overview of \glspl{PPM} is given to evaluate the technical difficulties when utilizing personal data.
Furthermore, we categorize \glspl{DDBM} and evaluate which impact \gls{PPM}s exert on these models.

%Finding
Generally speaking, the impact of applying \gls{PPM}s to the models is exceptionally noticeable in gaining users' trust, which is an essential factor for a successful \gls{BM}.

%Take-home message
A trade-off between the usability of personal data and the protection remains relevant in the foreseeable future.
